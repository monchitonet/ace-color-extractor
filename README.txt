Extract and display the most used colors from post thumbnails.

== Description ==

You can add the color palette to your posts in two ways:

1. Adding the shortcode [ace_palette] in your post.

2. Adding the following PHP code to your custom template, inside PHP tags:

// Display the color palette extracted by the plugin.
if( function_exists('extract_and_display_color_palette')) {
	$color_palette = extract_and_display_color_palette($content);
	echo $color_palette;
} else {
	// do nothing
}

This will add both the palette and the download link to your post.
