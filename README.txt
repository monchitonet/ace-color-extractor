Extract and display the most used colors from post thumbnails.

== Description ==

You can add the color palette to your posts in two ways:

1. Adding the shortcode [ace_palette] in your post.

2. Adding the following PHP code to your custom template, inside PHP tags:

// Display the color palette extracted by the plugin.
if( function_exists('extract_and_display_color_palette')) {
	$color_palette = extract_and_display_color_palette('');
	echo $color_palette;
} else {
	// do nothing
}

This will add both the palette and the download link to your post.

3. You can adjust the number of colors to extract from the image and the colors similarity threshold in the options page in Settings > ACE Color Extractor
